# Using TypeChain on frontend and backend

This project demonstrates how to use TypeScript types, via TypeChain, in DApp development on Rootstock.

## Contents of the repo
- `chain` Hardhat smart contract development environment
  - `contracts/MeowToken.sol` - demo Solidity smart contract
  - `tasks/deploy.ts` token deployment Hardhat task that:
    - compiles smart contracts, generates Hardhat artifacts and TypeChain typings
    - deploys smart contracts to a desired network
    - copies TypeChain typings to the frontend folder
  - `hardhat.config.ts` Hardhat config file with Rootstock networks configuration
- `front` React boilerplate application
  - `src/App.ts` App main component that:
    - imports `ethers.js` convenience library 
    - imports TypeChain typings and deployed token address, generated by Hardhat
    - connects to Metamask and wraps its provider with `ethers.js` provider
    - uses TypeChain generated classes to connect to deployed smart contract
    - invokes smart contract function to query connected user balance

## Installation and Usage
1. Install dependencies of the `chain` folder
```shell
cd chain
npm install
```
2. Compile and deploy smart contracts, generate artifacts and TypeChain typings
```shell
npx hardhat deploy --network rsktestnet
```
3. Install dependencies of the `front` folder
```shell
cd front
npm install
```
4. Run the React app
```shell
npm start
```
