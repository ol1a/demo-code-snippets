# Force

Some contracts will simply not take your money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The goal of this level is to make RBTC balance of the contract greater than zero.

  Things that might help:

- Fallback methods
- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Meow {/*

                   MEOW ?
         /\_/\   /
    ____/ o o \
  /~____  =ø= /
 (______)__m_m)

*/}
```
